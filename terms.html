If the credit card payment is not received by the Company from the card issuer (or its agent or affiliate), you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by Company. Your card issuer's agreement governs your use of your designated card, and you must refer to such agreement (not this Agreement) with respect to your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. You are responsible for overdraft fees and all other fees charged by your card issuer. You agree that the Company may (at its option) accumulate charges incurred during your monthly billing cycle and submit them as one or more charges during or at the end of each cycle, and that the Company may delay obtaining authorization from your card issuer until submission of the accumulated charges. This means that accumulated charges may appear on the statement you receive from your card issuer.

You understand and agree that the Company is entitled to obtain such updated card details, store them and use them to bill charges.

You should verify your identity as requested. Company shall send you a confirmation reply (for your records). Charges already applied to your account are generally non-refundable. Refunds, if applicable, at the sole discretion of Company, or as outlined in specific promotional offers, are often issued after the initial charges have been billed, as originally scheduled, on the applicable billing statement, even if the refund request was made prior to the close of the billing cycle. Refunds are not provided on other optional service fees, such as voice-over fees. There shall be a limit of one refund per account, company or person. Refunds will only be issued to the original credit card used at the time of purchase. Refunds are non-transferable. You must retain a copy of your cancellation request and a copy of our confirmation, with date/time stamps, until receipt of the refund. Refunds will be issued within 30 days of confirmation. Cancellation by Company, due to breach of this Agreement, or other provided terms or policies, disqualifies any and all entitlements to potential refunds.<br>    Providing Notification to Company<br>  You must promptly notify the Company of changes to: (a) the account number or expiration date of your designated credit card; (b) your billing address for the designated credit card; and (c) the name of each member whom you have authorized to use your BoxIT account.

A Customer Service representative will assist you with terminating your BoxIT account in accordance with the Company's Verification Procedures.

The Company reserves the right to do so without prior notice, provided that the Company will attempt to confirm such termination or suspension by subsequent notice. In addition, the Company reserves the right to suspend or terminate your BoxIT account without notice upon rejection of any credit card charges or if your card issuer (or its agent or affiliate) seeks return of payments previously made to the Company when the Company believes you are liable for the charge. We may assess an additional fee of twenty-five dollars ($25) for any check or charge (credit card or bank account) returned for nonpayment, or for any item required to be processed manually outside of our automatic billing/charging system, and this fee may be automatically added to your bill in these events. If your account is suspended or terminated and the Company later reactivates your account, the Company may also charge you a re-activation fee of $25 (in addition to any Late Fee(s) you may also be charged for a delinquent account), in the Company's sole and exclusive discretion. Such rights are in addition to and not in lieu of any other legal rights or remedies available to the Company. The Company reserves the right to limit use of the Services or to terminate any account if we believe unreasonable usage has occurred on such account or if the Services are used in a manner that is not permitted by this Agreement. The Company also reserves the right to take any action with respect to the Services that it deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion if the Company believes you or your usage may create liability for the Company, compromise or disrupt the Services for you or others or cause the Company to lose (in whole or in part) the services of the Company's suppliers.<br><br>12.

This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes, but is not limited to any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Services, the Company software, the BoxIT Website, the Agreement or any aspect of the relationship between you and the Company. You agree that, by agreeing to the Agreement, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration provision does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against the Company on your behalf. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your account.<br><br>    A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to the Company should be addressed to: j2 Global, Inc., ATTN: Legal Department, 6922 Hollywood Boulevard, 5th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90028, USA (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If the Company and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or the Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by the Company or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or the Company is entitled. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org. If you are required to pay a filing fee, after the Company receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000.<br><br>    The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by the Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of the Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision. Unless the Company and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place by video or telephone conference. If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, the Company agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator is not authorized to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party’s actual damages, and may not, in any event, make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.<br><br>    The Company may make a written settlement offer anytime before an arbitrator is selected. If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of the Company’s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if the Company did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then the Company will pay you the amount of the award or US$1,000, whichever is greater. Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.<br><br>    YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and the Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.<br><br>LEGAL NOTICES<br><br>    Trademark Information<br>    <br>    Single Copy License<br>    <br>    The materials at the BoxIT Site, www.BoxIT.com and the web pages within it (the "Site"), are copyrighted and any unauthorized use of such materials may violate copyright, trademark and other laws.
